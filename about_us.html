        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
          BookIt, formally known as TripTip, started as a small, unserious local
          business founded by Chavae Marcus, Ca-Jaye Clarke, and Keon Noble in
          March 2005. Keon had always been a great planner, and when Chavae
          suggested he use his planning skills to start a business, he agreed.
          TripTip was about planning vacation trips for those who struggled with
          indecisiveness, had poor planning skills, had no time to plan, ect. In
          September 2007, they decided to expand the business and started to
          cater for more than just vacations. This is when TripTip became
          BookIt. At this point, BookIt (TripTip) had made half a million, had
          an office space, and had five employees. From there, it continued to
          grow into what it is now: BookIt.
